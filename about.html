    <center><h1>About LearnBuddy</h1></center>
    <p>
      LearningBuddy was born out of our struggle as software engineering students.
      During our journey, we often found ourselves overwhelmed by the vast amount
      of resources available online. <br />
      It was challenging to navigate through the clutter and find high-quality
      materials that truly helped us grasp the concepts. <br />
      As we searched for a solution to streamline our learning process, the idea
      for "LearningBuddy" began to take shape. We envisioned a platform that would
      serve as a one-stop destination for software engineering students like
      ourselves, <br />
      providing curated educational resources tailored to our specific needs.
      Drawing from our own experiences and frustrations, we set out to create
      "LearningBuddy" with the goal of simplifying the learning experience for
      others in the field. <br />
      We wanted to build a platform that not only offered comprehensive courses
      but also fostered a sense of community among learners in Ghana. <br />
      With "LearningBuddy", we aim to empower students to take control of their
      learning journey, offering them the support and resources they need to
      succeed in the dynamic field of software engineering. <br />
      It's a project inspired by our own struggles and fueled by the desire to
      make learning more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
